This website is responsive and the buttons work. 
I used minimal JavaScript to help with the hamburger and menu links. 

The website will show sections ABOUT, PROJECTS, EXPERIENCE, CAUSE, AND CONTACT if using the screen size of 1220 x 935 px. While, the bar will show if the dimension is less than that. The bar when clicked will show the sections which when clicked will direct you to that specific section.

The buttons will also redirect you to another website when clicked.
